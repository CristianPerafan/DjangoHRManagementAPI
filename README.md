# DjangoHRManagementAPI

The "Django HR Management API" project aims to develop an advanced REST API using the Django Python framework for human resources management in our company. This API will allow users to effectively manage employee information, including personal details, work histories, attendance records, and salary records. The API will offer strong authentication and authorization, custom reporting, email notifications, and comprehensive documentation for ease of use. API security will be ensured through practices such as token authentication and protection against common attacks. Additionally, the project will be designed to be scalable and easy to maintain, allowing the company's future growth to be managed efficiently.
